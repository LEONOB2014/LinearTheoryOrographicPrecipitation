about=This plugin implements the Linear Theory of Orographic Precipitation model by Smith and Barstad (2004). The model includes airflow dynamics, condensed water advection, and downslope evaporation. Vertically integrated steady-state governing equations for condensed water are solved using Fourier transform techniques. The precipitation field is computed quickly by multiplying the terrain transform by a wavenumber-dependent transfer function. Input can be (almost) any GDAL-readable raster, but output is currently limited to GTiff. If no input raster is given (check gaussian bump box), the default parameters will reproduce Figure 4c in the Smith and Barstad paper.  This plugin requires the installation of GDAL, OGR, Numpy, and scipy.fftpack. The code is fast even for larger rasters if sufficient RAM is available. However, processing large rasters with insuffiecient RAM is very slow. Before using this plugin, please read the original manuscript of Smith and Barstad (2004) to understand the model physics and its limitations.
